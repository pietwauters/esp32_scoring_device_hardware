# BOM - Bill of materials  PCB rev. 1.2b

> [!NOTE]
> All items marked with * are optional. JST or header connectors can be substituted by soldering the wires directly to the board or ESP.

> [!TIP]
> JST- XH 2.54mm are the recommended connector type for the connectors because they are keyed and you can't connect them the wrong way.
> Simple header pins work fine too, but make sure to orient the plug correctly. 
> JSTs can be bought as kit with wire and crimper. 
> Connectors are preferred over soldering directly to the board for serviceability.
